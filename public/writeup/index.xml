      <description>Write up for the HackTheBox web challenge called ExpressionalRebel
Expressional Rebel was a very entertaining medium web challenge, the solution involved exploiting a url Uconfusion vulnerability along with a regex injection, something I believe most have not tinkered with (at least it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case for me!)
The vulnerable application was written in NodeJS, in this case we are provided the source code, which was crucial for this kind of challenge or it would&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty insane to solve!</description>
