## Whoami


I'm a security researcher and penetration tester with a deep passion for understanding and dissecting technology. I thrive on building innovative and secure solutions, as well as uncovering and exploiting security flaws. Those "aha!" moments, when I discover how something can be exploited and improved, are what drive me.

I enjoy collaborating with like-minded individuals, bouncing ideas around, and finding elegant solutions to complex problems. Leadership roles come naturally to me, and I relish the opportunity to guide teams toward effective outcomes.

Beyond the tech world, I'm into climbing, cooking, skateboarding, and chess. I am the happiest when I'm traveling and sharing good food with people who have interesting stories to tell are some of my favorite pastimes.

My goal? To learn something new every day, surround myself with great people, and have a blast while doing it.
