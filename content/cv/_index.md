## Whoami

My passion pushing me towards this industry is my hunger to deeply understand and dissect technology. I love building new and exciting things securely but also hunting security flaws in technology. I live for those "aha!" moments when you realize how something can be exploited and improved. I truly enjoy working in teams and have found myself thriving in positions of leadership. I love being in a room where ideas are bouncing on the walls, I love finding elegant solutions to difficult problems with like-minded people.

I love traveling, good food and being around people with a story to tell.

My biggest passions except from coding and security are: Thai Boxing, cooking, skateboarding and chess.

My goal in life is to learn something new everyday, being around great people and having a good time while doing so.
