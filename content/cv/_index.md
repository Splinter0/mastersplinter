## Whoami
I'm a security researcher and penetration tester with a deep passion for understanding and dissecting technology. I thrive on building innovative and secure solutions, as well as uncovering and exploiting security flaws. Those "aha!" moments, when I discover how something can be exploited and improved, are what drive me. I enjoy collaborating with like-minded individuals, bouncing ideas around, and finding elegant solutions to complex problems. Leadership roles come naturally to me, and I relish the opportunity to guide teams toward effective outcomes.
