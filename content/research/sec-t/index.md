# My Sec-T Presentation

Hi there! This year I had the pleasure to attend and present at Sec-T for the very first time! It was overall a great conference with lots of cool hackers and presentations. 

I got to show off my research and findings in Swedish BankID along with some other insights in research I've been doing in other Cross-Device Authentication protocols.

Here I attach the full sides:

As well as the recording from Sec-T official's YouTube channel:
